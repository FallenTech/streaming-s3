A simple and light-weight S3 upload streaming module for NodeJS.


## Benefits & Features
* Super fast and super easy to use
* Low memory usage
* Nothing is written to disk during upload
* Parallel part uploading
* No need to know total size of the object
* Implicit retry mechanism for failed part uploads
* Tons of configurable options
* Simple interface (Asynchronous and evented)
* Downloading and uploading statistics (U/D speed and U/D time)
* Proper usage of streams and graceful error handling
* Production ready (Used and tested on production environments, uploading gigabytes of files to S3)
* Uses official AWS SDK


## Installation

```
$ npm install streaming-s3
```


## Version 0.4 and 0.3.x Changes
Starting from version 0.4 onwards you can pass in an object that is used to configure the underlying aws-sdk. This can contain **region** and other parameters.

* Old Constructor (Still supported)
```js
var uploader = new streamingS3(fStream, 'accessKey', 'secretKey', ...
```

* New Constructor
```js
var uploader = new streamingS3(fStream, {accessKeyId: 'accessKey', secretAccessKey: 'secretKey'}, ...
```


## Example Usage


### Example 1: Uploading local file with callback.

```js
var streamingS3 = require('streaming-s3'),
    fs = require('fs');

var fStream = fs.CreateReadStream(__dirname + '/video.mp4');
var uploader = new streamingS3(fStream, {accessKeyId: 'accessKey', secretAccessKey: 'secretKey'},
  {
    Bucket: 'example.streaming-s3.com',
    Key: 'video.mp4',
    ContentType: 'video/mp4'
  },  function (err, resp, stats) {
  if (err) return console.log('Upload error: ', e);
  console.log('Upload stats: ', stats);
  console.log('Upload successful: ', resp);
  }
);
```

### Example 2: Uploading local file without callback.

```js
var streamingS3 = require('streaming-s3'),
    fs = require('fs');

var fStream = fs.CreateReadStream(__dirname + '/video.mp4');
var uploader = new streamingS3(fStream, {accessKeyId: 'accessKey', secretAccessKey: 'secretKey'},
  {
    Bucket: 'example.streaming-s3.com',
    Key: 'video.mp4',
    ContentType: 'video/mp4'
  }
);
  
uploader.begin(); // important if callback not provided.

uploader.on('data', function (bytesRead) {
  console.log(bytesRead, ' bytes read.');
});

uploader.on('part', function (number) {
  console.log('Part ', number, ' uploaded.');
});

// All parts uploaded, but upload not yet acknowledged.
uploader.on('uploaded', function (stats) {
  console.log('Upload stats: ', stats);
});

uploader.on('finished', function (resp, stats) {
  console.log('Upload finished: ', resp);
});

uploader.on('error', function (e) {
  console.log('Upload error: ', e);
});
```


### Example 3: Uploading remote file without callback and options

```js
var streamingS3 = require('streaming-s3'),
    request = require('request');

var rStream = request.get('http://www.google.com');
var uploader = new streamingS3(rStream, {accessKeyId: 'accessKey', secretAccessKey: 'secretKey'},
  {
    Bucket: 'example.streaming-s3.com',
    Key: 'google.html',
    ContentType: 'text/html'
  },
  {
    concurrentParts: 2,
    waitTime: 10000,
    retries: 1,
    maxPartSize: 10*1024*1024,
  }
);
  
uploader.begin(); // important if callback not provided.

uploader.on('data', function (bytesRead) {
  console.log(bytesRead, ' bytes read.');
});

uploader.on('part', function (number) {
  console.log('Part ', number, ' uploaded.');
});

// All parts uploaded, but upload not yet acknowledged.
uploader.on('uploaded', function (stats) {
  console.log('Upload stats: ', stats);
});

uploader.on('finished', function (resp, stats) {
  console.log('Upload finished: ', resp);
});

uploader.on('error', function (e) {
  console.log('Upload error: ', e);
});
```
